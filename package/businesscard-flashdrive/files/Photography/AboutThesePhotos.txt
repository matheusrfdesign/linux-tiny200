These photos are a sampling of my photography portfolio.  Being behind a camera
is my creative outlet, and I love being able to look back on past experiences.

The photos of Natural Bridges, Horseshoe Bend, and Shiprock come from a trip my
wife and I made to the American southwest in the beginning of 2018.  It is an
exceptionally beautiful area of the world, and it is really hard to point a
camera in the wrong direction.

The shot of Horseshoe Bend is the classic shot.  It was also the photo I put
the least effort into---the key was arriving just before sunrise (this helps
with both the huge tourist crowd and the light; the sun is behind me in this
photo).  I mounted a 12mm lens, set the tripod on the edge of the cliff, and had
this photo about 10 seconds later.

Shiprock is a natural landmark in New Mexico on the Navajo Nation.  It has
religious significance to the Navajo, so it is not possible to get closer than
a few miles away by car.  When I took this photo in January, it had just
finished snowing the day before and the sky was overcast; it's unusual to have
a photo of Shiprock in fog like this.  I could have composited out the telephone
poles, but I actually kind of like them as they give a sense of scale.

The photo of Owachomo Bridge is from Natural Bridges National Monument.  This
photo involved about 15 minutes' worth of light collection at 18mm and f/2.8 
(plus another hour or so of setup).  I took multiple exposures and stacked them
using software to amplify the night sky against the noise of the camera sensor.
Natural Bridges is one of the best places in the world for astrophotography
because they go to great lengths to minimize light pollution.

The other photos are miscellaneous photos from various one-off projects.  They
make good desktop wallpapers!  I also enjoy taking portraits, but I've omitted
that part of my portfolio here.
